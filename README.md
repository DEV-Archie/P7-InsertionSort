# Insertion Sort

<h3>Given an array arr[] of n elements, write a function to sort the given array.<br></h3>
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.<br><br>

Input:

```java
arr[] = { 5,3,7,1,8,6,9 }
```

Output:

```java
arr[] = { 1,3,5,6,7,8,9 }
```

Time Complexity:

```python
O(n^2)
```
